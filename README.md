# opencv_files
OpenCV collection of files

This page was started to help collect useful OpenCV code, and provide a location for tutorial code. Each program comes with a Visual Studio project that was tested working using visual studio 2013 with the Ceemple plugin installed. The code will work fine on other operating system that have OpenCV installed.

Here is a link to tutorials that accompany this code:
